        <p>
            Thank you for playing Escape the Hedge Maze with the Bros.  The bros need your help in desperate times - they're stuck in a hedge maze and only at least one other real bro can help them escape.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Controls</b>
            <br />
            Standard controls - use WADS for your arrow keys and enter to initiate bro chat. <u>Hit 1 turn on/off audio!!  Hit 2 to turn on/off music!!</u>
            <br /><br />
            <b>Gates</b>
            <br />

            <br />
            You must navigate the maze, but at some point you will find gates that need to have a bro on a pressure plate in order to get through.  Use your bro weight to stand on the plate and let a bro through.
            Once through you can find another pressure plate that is on the other side that will open the door for your bro.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Skeletons</b>
            <br />

            <br />
            Skeletons are not bros and in fact they're anti bro if you can believe it.  Skeletons also have no respect for hedges and will go through them at will (not very bro like).  Avoid them at all costs or you will be sent back to the start.

            <br /><br />
            <b>Find the Exit!</b>
            <br />

            <br />
            Find the exit and make sure all bros get to it to exit the maze. NO BROS LEFT BEHIND. Another maze will generate after you get to the exit.
